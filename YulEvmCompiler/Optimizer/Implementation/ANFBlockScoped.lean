# ANF pass 1 — block-scoped operand flattening

The first of two passes (see `ANFFlattenBlocks` for pass 2). This pass flattens
each **straight-line** statement's operands into atoms, scoping the introduced
temporaries in a fresh sub-block so the enclosing `restore` discharges them
locally — no persistent-temporary frame invariant needed:

```text
sstore(add(a,b), c)  ⟶  { let t := add(a,b); sstore(t, c) }
x := f(g(y))         ⟶  { let t := g(y); x := f(t) }
let x := f(g(y))     ⟶  let x; { let t := g(y); x := f(t) }
```

The `let` case is the subtle one: the *binding* `x` must survive past the
temporaries, so it is declared **outside** the block (`let x;`) and assigned
**inside** it (`x := f(t)`), where the temporaries are in scope. A statement can
therefore expand to a *list* of statements, so the transform is `Stmt → List Stmt`
(and `bsStmts` flat-maps it). Control-flow statements recurse into their bodies;
the condition/scrutinee is left unchanged (atomizing those is a later refinement).

Pass 2 (block flattening / inlining) then lifts the sub-blocks back out, and the
two compose to the persistent-temporary form. Soundness of each per-statement
rewrite is a local `EquivStmts [s] (bsStmt1 P s)` (via `restore_prefix` and the
empty-scope congruence), composed with an `EquivStmts` append congruence.

This file: the transform. The `EquivStmts` soundness lives in
`ANFBlockScopedSound`.
