# YulEvmCompiler.Optimizer.Implementation.InlineCallsCarryResolve

**Closure of the call-carrying inlining relation under layout resolution** —
the object-path bridge for `InlineCallsCarry`, the exact analogue of
`InlineCallsResolve` for the plain `InlineCalls` pass.

Layout resolution (`resolveForLayout*`) rewrites `dataoffset`/`datasize`
*builtins* into number literals; it never touches variable names, statement
shapes, or `.call` nodes.  Consequently every classifier and side condition of
the carry pass is resolution-invariant — `carryExpr`, `carryStmt(s)`,
`carryCases`, the call-name collectors `exprCallNames`/`stmtsCallNames`, the
classifier `carryClassifyDecl`, the shadow prune `carrySurvives`, the
profitability gate `carryOK` — and so the whole transform *commutes* with
resolution:

    resolveForLayoutStmts L (inlineCallsCarryBlock b)
      = inlineCallsCarryBlock (resolveForLayoutStmts L b).

The payoff `resolveInlineCallsCarryBlock_equiv` then follows from the pass's
own soundness (`inlineCallsCarry.sound`) applied at the resolved block.

## House style

The site-rewrite facts (`inlineCore_resolve`, `siteOK_resolve`,
`lookupDelta_resolve`, `resolveIDecl`, `resolveDelta`, …) are *reused verbatim*
from `InlineCallsResolve` — the carry pass shares `inlineCore`/`siteOK`/site
shapes with `InlineCalls`, only the classifier differs.  The carry-specific
resolution-invariance lemmas below are near-verbatim copies of the
`scopedStmt_resolve`/`hoistDecls_resolve`/`deltaExtend_resolve` family from
`InlineCallsResolve`, adapted to the carry classifier (`carry*` for `scoped*`,
`carryDeltaExtend`/`carrySurvives` for `deltaExtend`).  Verbatim duplication is
the deliberate house style here, not a candidate for refactoring/sharing.
