# YulEvmCompiler.Optimizer.Implementation.InlineCalls

**Statement-level inlining of call-free helper functions.** The verified
backend's function-call protocol costs ≈ `24 + 2·|args| + 6·|rets|` gas per
call (return-address `PUSH32`, zeroed return slots, jumps, `JUMPDEST`s,
parameter pops, return rotation, dynamic return jump), and solc's unoptimized
IR — this compiler's input — routes every external call through a chain of
~15 tiny helpers (`external_fun_*` → `abi_decode_tuple_*` → `abi_decode_t_*`
→ `validator_revert_*`, `fun_X` → `fun_Y` wrappers, `zero_value_*`,
`revert_error_*`). solc's own FullInliner flattens all of it; `InlineHelpers`
only reaches single-expression bodies. This pass inlines *statement-level*
calls — `let xs := f(as)`, `xs := f(as)`, and bare `f(as)` — whose callee
body is:

* **call-free** (no `.call` anywhere): the body's execution then never
  consults the function environment, so the inlined copy needs no
  closure/scope-resolution reasoning (`Step` only reads `funs` in its
  `call*` rules);
* free of `funDef`/`forLoop`/`break`/`continue`/`leave` — except one optional
  *trailing* `leave`, which is dropped (`callOk` accepts `normal` and `leave`
  outcomes identically);
* **well-scoped within `params ∪ rets`**, checked binder-aware
  (`scopedStmts`). This is a soundness condition, not hygiene: the pointwise
  spec quantifies over all caller environments, and an ill-scoped body
  converts callee stuckness (read of an unbound name) or a callee no-op
  (assignment to an unbound name — `VEnv.set` skips) into a read/write of a
  caller variable of the same name.

## The rewrite

For an inlinable `function f(p₁…pₙ) -> r₁…rₘ { ss }`:

```
let xs := f(a₁…aₙ)   ⟶   let xs
                          { let r₁, …, rₘ            // zero-init, like bindZeros
                            let pₙ := aₙ … let p₁ := a₁ // right-to-left, Yul arg order
                            { ss }                    // own scope, like the call's body block
                            x₁ := r₁ … xₘ := rₘ }
```

(the assign form omits the leading `let xs`; the expression-statement form has
`m = 0` and no trailing assigns). The inner environment at `{ ss }` is
literally `callOk`'s callee environment `params.zip argvals ++ bindZeros rets`
stacked on the caller's; the `{ ss }` wrap reproduces the call's body-block
`restore`, so body locals die before the returns are read. Per-site side
conditions (checked syntactically):

* exact arities `|as| = |ps|`, `|xs| = |rs|` — the call is *stuck* otherwise,
  and the replacement must not run where the original is stuck;
* `(vars(as) ∪ xs) ∩ (ps ∪ rs) = ∅` — argument reads and result writes must
  not be captured by the freshly bound parameter/return names;
* for the `let` form additionally `vars(as) ∩ xs = ∅` — the original evaluates
  arguments *before* `xs` exist, the replacement after `let xs` zero-binds
  them;
* `xs.Nodup` — `letVal` binds `xs.zip vals` (first occurrence wins on read),
  while sequential assignment applies `VEnv.set` left-to-right (last write to
  a duplicate wins); the two disagree on duplicates.

`for`-loop `init` sites are left alone (mirroring `DeadLits`); helper *chains*
collapse leaf-first by iterating the pipeline — a call-free callee inlines
this round, which makes its caller call-free for the next round.

Function declarations visible at a site are threaded as a syntactic
environment `Δ` (most recent scope first), extended at each block by the
block's hoisted definitions and pruned of shadowed names — mirroring
`hoist`/`lookupFun`, so a `Δ` hit *is* the `lookupFun` result.

/-! ### Transform-only profitability and stack-pressure guards

Neither guard affects soundness (the relation's skip rules absorb any site the
transform declines); they gate *when* inlining pays.

* **Benefit**: the call protocol costs ≈ `24 + 2·|ps| + 6·|rs|` gas; the
  inlined residue (return zero-inits, read-out assignments, block-exit pops)
  costs ≈ `2·|ps| + 13·|rs|`, so the net is ≈ `24 − 7·|rs|` — negative from
  three returns up (measured: `unusedFunctionParameterPruner/multiple_return`,
  `stackReuse/reuse_slots_function*`).
* **Stack pressure**: the backend keeps locals on the EVM stack with a hard
  `DUP16`/`SWAP16` reach; inlining stacks the callee frame on the caller's
  live locals, and iterated rounds compound nested frames (measured:
  `fullSuite/abi2.yul` stopped compiling without the bound). -/

-- the propagation depth gate.

/-! ### The site rewrite -/

/-- Capture check for the argument bindings. The replacement binds
right-to-left (`let pₙ := aₙ … let p₁ := a₁` after `let rs`), matching Yul's
argument evaluation order, so `aᵢ` evaluates with `{p_{i+1}, …, pₙ} ∪ rs`
freshly bound above the caller's environment — those are the only names it
must avoid. In particular a callee parameter may share its name with the
argument that *feeds* it (solc's `validator_revert_t_uint256(value)` idiom):
the binding happens after the read. -/

`lookupDelta` + `siteOK`); everything else is rebuilt structurally, function
bodies included (their visible scope chain is the same `Δ` — Yul functions
close over the scopes of their defining block). `for`-loop `init` is left
untouched. The inserted copy is *not* revisited (chains collapse across
